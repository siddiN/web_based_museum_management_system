Museum Management System is a simple web-based project developed using PHP, HTML, and CSS. It is designed to streamline museum visitor bookings, artifact management, and artifact appraisal through a centralized admin dashboard. This system helps administrators efficiently manage artifacts, maintain historical records, schedule viewing sessions, and evaluate the cultural or historical value of artifacts.

Visitors can book their visit slots online and explore the museum’s artifacts. At the end of their visit, they can participate in quizzes based on different collectors. All backend operations like bookings, artifacts, and evaluations are handled by the Admin.
